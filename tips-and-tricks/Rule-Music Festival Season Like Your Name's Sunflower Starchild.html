      <h1>Test: Rule Music Festival Season Like Your Name's Sunflower Starchild</h1>
      <p>So you somehow managed to buy tickets to Coachella, Lollapalooza and Sasquatch. Youâ€™ve got more face paint and fringe than a Renaissance fair, and enough tapestries to dress an elephant.

While your aesthetic may be crucial to your vibe, your smartphone is essential to the experience. Hereâ€™s how youâ€™ll stay in touch when it matters, never miss an epic DJ set, and capture every memory using your Galaxy.</p>

Unleash the Greatness of Ultra Power Saving Mode

All hail the almighty power of this feature. If youâ€™re down to a 10% battery charge, you can receive calls and texts for up to 24 hours*â€”a crucial Sunday night setting. For quick access, activate it in your notifications bar. You can also find it in Settings &gt; Power saving.

Capture Nostalgia in Real Time

This is your time to put flowers in your hair and sport tinted circular sunglasses for your own Summer of Love memories. Make sure to capture all the authentic, candid culture filter-free (you can always add those later). Be sure to clear your photo library pre-festival so you have plenty of room for vivid, HDR photos.

â€¦But Put the Camera Away for the Music

Hey, festivals are meant to be enjoyed IRL, not through a screen. Take your concert pics early on, then stow away your Galaxy and live in the moment for a little. Check out this article for concert-friendly phone etiquette tips.

Activate Phone Tracking

Maybe you leave your phone at a burrito stand. Or under your pillow. Or in your car.

Point is, when youâ€™re bopping around, your phone bops too. Activate Samsung Find My Mobile to geo-locate it if it gets lost.

When Night Falls, Use the Flashlight

Canâ€™t find your glowsticks for the midnight DJ set? Use the Flashlight to shine a light on your campsite. Add it your home screen by finding it in the widget menu.

Download the Festival App

Most festys these days have apps that have schedules, news and other fun stuff that youâ€™ll probably find useful. Download it to stay up-to-date on any surprises.

Or Just Take a Picture of the Schedule

And set it as the background to your lock screen so youâ€™ll never miss a show.
